Notes on installing antinat 0.90:

This product requires GNU make or Microsoft NMAKE.  If you are building on
*nix, and don't have GNU make, we recommend you obtain it before attempting
to install antinat.

BUGS:

UDP on OS X.  Apparently it thinks the TCP and UDP connections come from
different places (one on loopback, other on ethernet.)  Makes no sense to me.

Binding still reports zero as the address.  Suprisingly, this seems to work
with a lot of applications that use this.  The issue here is that you can't
*know* what IP the remote host should contact just by listening; the
interface is only determined when the connection arrives, but client apps
need to know where to send the remote host or no connection will arrive.
Solving this problem requires knowing the complete routing table on the
machine on which antinat runs.

DANGEROUS STUFF:
IPv6 support compiles, but is somewhat incomplete and is not very well tested.
There is currently no support for creating IPv6 address firewall rules, so it's
an all-or-nothing affair.  By default, IPv6 support is not compiled.  If you
want it, compile --with-ipv6.  Also, there appear to be issues running IPv4
if compiling --with-ipv6.

Win32 builds compile with MinGW, or MSVC.

UDP support is in there, but I'm finding it really hard to test due to a lack
of UDP client apps.  Hopefully, if I can't find them, you're not using them,
but if you are, let me know of a good SOCKSified UDP app so I can take UDP for
a spin.
